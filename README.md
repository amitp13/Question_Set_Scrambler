# Question Set Scrambler

### Problem Overview:

While working as a Teacher's Assistant in Rutgers, One of my task included creating sets of given question papers. The process was tedious and manual. So here is simple code to automate the process. The input will be a word document with questions numbered as 1,2,3,4.... with answers and multiple choices. The output will be a word document saved in the destination folder with question jumbled. Currently the code caters to a specific form of input. Future scope includes flexibility in the input.

### How to use
1. Download all the files to local directory.
2. Open input.py
3. Give the local path to the file to be scrambled in the source variable. Make sure the file contains only questions, multiple choices, and answers.  
4. Input the file name in save_as variable. No need for an extension.  
5. Give a local path for where the file will be saved in the destination variable.
6. Run input.py from with console path set to the same directory.
